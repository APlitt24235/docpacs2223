- The grading policy allows for 5 school days after the original due date to turn an assignment in unprompted.
-- I still want you to coordinate with me if you know your work will be late.
- The grading policy requires coordination with the instructor to accept any work more than five school days late.
-- I wouldn't make you responsible for work if you are sick, but Covid policies are NOT NOT NOT a free vacation like they have been in the past.
-- If you are not sick enough to not use Discord/Social Media, then you are not sick enough to message your classmates and instructor and updating them on your status.

- If you did not turn in your Sept. 9th DocPac by Sept. 16th, and did not ask me for an extension:
-- You received 0% score on all assignments in that DocPac, irrespective of other documentation of the assignment
-- There is no further negotiation.

- Think of a number
- I will pick a number and flip a pog
- if (heads && myNum > yourNum) you receive a pog
- else if (heads && myNum < yourNum) you receive a pog
- Was I lower or higher?
- Prove it

- The primary purpose of Documentation is to keep track of things
-- Many students have already saved their scores from being zeros by saying, "Mr. Smith, we talked about this on Teams"
-- I can't POSSIBLY keep track of every absence across 60 kids and multiple due dates
--- Maybe if I had tools to help me, but I don't have any good ones I can use

- The secondary purpose of Documentation is resolving disputes
-- You signed the syllabus, have access to it in your class documentation, and the policies are posted on two walls
-- How do you think "Mr. Smith never told us that" is going to work?
-- Unfortunately, some students have resorting to lying
-- If you do not have it in writing it is as good as lying
-- There is no deadlier lie than the one we tell ourselves

-Excuses I've heard
-- I Did not lose your docpac
-- you can't just make up your own assignments
-- I would have asked for help but you were busy. I will make time for you outside of class if you are making time for my class, too


- There are poopers in the classroom
-- Some people want to poop in the punchbowl, because they don't want to be at the party
-- Microsoft Teams is on the edge of being pooped in, making us go back to email and Schoology
---This is good for the pooper, because they won't have to use Teams to be responsible
-- If you do not want to be here, leave

- Coat hanger and shoebox

- My job to provide clarity
- Serious contribution to a issue, discussions, or documentation
-- Advanced an issue that was stalled
-- Fixed an issue (by solving)
-- Completed a "section" or feature in documentation
-- Detailed and ACCURATE comments on one module / file
-- Expanded details on a "section" or feature
-- Provide an idea in a discussion that is accepted as part of the project

- Rules for PRs
-- Don't delete or modify any files or folders
-- Only copy and modify new files
-- Follow the instructions carefully on where to place thenew files


//I don't want to see what your friends know
const greeting = {
    say : "Hi.",
    talk:function() {
      console.log(this.talk)
    }
  }


- What is up with the binder shelf?!!! When has it ever been like this?
-- This is the kind of environment we think this is
-- This is what I mean when I say you are disappointing me
-- You are teaching the Juniors bad habits

I desperately need more assessments

How do I submit a PR when I've already submitted one?
- Just commit to the same branch and push to origin
- We should really be using branches per week
- Edit the bottom of files, not the top, if possible
I'm getting better at github myself.
- Imagine Github is like a machine you can stick your DocPacs in
- Some of you are cramming live birds into that machine
- Aladdin "you may only touch the lamp and nothing else"
- Comitting to you own branch is great to backup changes as you make them and syncing without oneDrive
- Syllabus was deleted by a bad PR and I didn't catch it.

Look at the commits and show where I had to fix mistakes

I am really inspired by some of the Smurfing IRL responses.
- I can tell that some people really take this class seriously
- Sometimes, I get so focused on a few poopers that I forget all of the great students
- I realized it's not several poopers pooping a little, but a few poopers pooping A LOT

Why is nobody talking about the three logans?

Grading rubric
- Start with 10 and subtract by condition

Write scripts for your grading processes

It's too easy for me to say "teens do this"
- When I say that I really mean "people do this", but all of my coworkers are teenagers
- I also say it knowing that many people "crystalize" into a mindset if it's never challenged before a certain age
