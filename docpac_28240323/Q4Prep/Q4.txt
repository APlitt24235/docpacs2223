<! Game Idea !>
A civilization game based around prior empires and their growth, with random events drastically changing how you play.
For example, the Persian empire will be available and focused around economic growth, while the Romans will be around military power.


Each faction will have their own special units, alongside of global units.
For example, Romans would gain access to gladiators and hoplites while Persians gain merchant ships early


As well as special units, the factions will gain passive buffs others do not have.
For example, Romans will do increased damage when outnumbered and Persians will have increased crop yield and event luck.



<! Determined classes !>

Beginning of game:
	Neanderthals - increased strength, morons
	Homo Habilis - Quicker access to tools, stronger tool paths
	Homo Erectis - Domestication of wolves to help w/ hunting, better crop yields	

Bronze Age:
	Persians - Better trade routes and increased luck + yields // Low firepower
	Romans - Increased firepower + combat strategy choices // Less job opportunity + yields + worse economy
	Germans - Increased intelligence with quicker access to late game weaponry,  // Increased worldwide animosity
	Britain - Defensively advanced with higher ranged damage, split path into the Americans // Bad early economy
		Americans - Incredible firepower // Terrible economy
		Britain (late) - Incredible defensive abilities // Great economy
